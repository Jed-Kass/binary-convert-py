Convert Binary IP address to Decimal notation

This is a short python script which converts a given IP address from its typical decimal notation,
e.g. 192.168.1.1
into its binary notation,
e.g. 11000000.1010100.00000001.00000001

Currently, you must enter the address one octet at a time. Parsing will be added in the near future.

NOTE: As of the latest commit, error handling and sanity tests are broken.
