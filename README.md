# binary-convert-py
Convert Binary IP address to Decimal notation

This is a short python script which converts a given IP address from its typical decimal notation,
e.g. 192.168.1.1

into its binary notation,

e.g. 11000000.1010100.00000001.00000001

As of Version 0.6 you may enter a full IP address and it will be parsed automatically.

As of Version 1.0 all error checking is fixed and functioning.
